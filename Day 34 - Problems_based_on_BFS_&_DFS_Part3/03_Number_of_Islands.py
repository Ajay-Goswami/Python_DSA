# 03. Number of Islands – LeetCode 200
# DFS based connected components problem

# Problem: Given a 2D grid of '1' (land) and '0' (water), count the number of islands.

# Input:
# grid = [
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]

# Output: 3

    if not grid:
        return 0

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count = 0

    def dfs(r, c):
        if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols:
            return
        if grid[r][c] != "1":
            return

        grid[r][c] = "0"   # mark visited
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r, c+1)
        dfs(r, c-1)

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == "1":
                count += 1
                dfs(r, c)

    return count
