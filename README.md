# PyDSA – Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)

This repository is created for **systematic revision of Data Structures & Algorithms**
using Python.

The focus is on **refreshing fundamentals, maintaining consistency, and keeping a clean reference for future revisions**.

The code is intentionally kept **simple, readable, and topic-focused**.
